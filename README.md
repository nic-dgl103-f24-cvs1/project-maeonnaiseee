Project Website Plan Content

1. Project Summary
   I have chosen to redesign the website for Art Adventures (https://www.artadventures.ca/). The primary purpose of the site is to encourage online bookings and generate interest in the variety of classes offered. The target audience is broad, as the organization advertises classes for young children (appealing to parents), as well as classes for teens, adults, and homeschooled children. The main message I want to convey is that these classes provide a safe, supportive environment where all students can thrive, regardless of their skill level. The main focus for users will be the "About" page, which highlights the available classes and services. The redesigned site will include multiple options for booking services and will improve accessibility, clarity, and organization, along with a fresh, modern design.

2. Look and feel
   The visual moods I would like to convey in the website are welcoming, clean but fun and vibrant with an artsy retro flair. I really like these two pages and think they are great inspiration for what Iâ€™d like to achieve.
