        <h2>Meet Art Teacher Alicia Lumb</h2>
        <p>
          Founder of Art Adventures, is a classically trained artist with a rich
          background in animation, film, and video game artistry. With training
          from Emily Carr University, North Island College, and the Art
          Institute of Vancouver, Alicia brings over a decade of experience as
          an environment painter and an educator. She is passionate about
          empowering students to create artwork they can feel proud of—guiding
          even beginners to paint pieces like Van Gogh's skyline. Alicia's
          teaching experience spans children, teens, and adults, combining her
          knowledge of art with her certifications in First Aid and childhood
          developmental psychology. She has a heart for community service,
          volunteering her time for art therapy with individuals with
          disabilities, dementia patients, and the elderly. Whether you're
          picking up a brush for the first time or looking to refine your
          skills, Alicia’s classes provide a supportive, inspiring environment
          for all.
